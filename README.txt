============================================================================
SOFTWARE
============================================================================
This software provides all the functions needed to compute approximate
solutions to Poisson's problem using the virtual element method for a given
polynomial degree on polygonal meshes.

============================================================================
PACKAGE
============================================================================

The directory contains the following files

README.txt            : this file
vem2d.m               : main function for the virtual element method for 
                        Poisson problem with homogeneous boundary conditions
vem2d_proj.m          : similar as vem2d, but only computes the vem
                        projector
bndryNodesVectors.m   : compute GL nodes on the boundary of an element and 
                        required normal and average vectors on the boundary
createPolynomials.m   : create list of exponents for the monomial basis
geomElement.m         : compute diameter, area and centroid of an element
getL2Error.m          : approximate the L2 error of the numerical solution
integrate.m           : auxiliary function that integrates a function over
                        a general polygon (given by the union of triangles)
meshSetup.m           : compute edge list, local to global ordering of dof
                        and dof on the boundary
precomputeIntegrals.m : precompute integrals over an element of the monomial
                        basis by using divergence theorem
quadInfoGL.m          : compute Gauss-Lobatto quadrature weights and nodes 
                        for the interval [0,1]
demo.m                : example with different options for mesh type and
                        degree approximation

The 'meshes' subdirectory also contains the following files

hexagons_xx.mat      : data structure for five hexagonal meshes
triangles_xx.mat     : data structure for five triangular meshes
voronoi_xx.mat       : data structure for five Voronoi meshes

See the paper "A numerical implementation for the high-order 2D VEM in 
MATLAB" for further explanations on the data structure.

============================================================================
HOW TO INSTALL
============================================================================

Unpack vem2d.zip. The directory vem2d will be created with all the needed 
files inside. Add the directory vem2d to the path in Matlab or change the 
current working directory to vem2d.

============================================================================
HOW TO USE
============================================================================

Running the method simply involves calling the 'vem2d' function with the
following three arguments:

    1. the mesh given by a struct 'mesh'
    2. the polynomial degree for the local spaces
    3. a function handle for the right hand side of the PDE

See demo.m for different examples.
